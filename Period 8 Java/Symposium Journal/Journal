Goal for Today: Today I will begin to research the skill I have chosen to implement into
	my program, DragonLand. Due to unforeseen of another group spying, we have talked as a 
	group and made a plan that we would contribute to pay for a private repository. In addition,
	Kat and I have researched for png files that we would use to create a new page for 
	incubation.
