Today I will begin to research the skill I have chosen to implement into
	my program, DragonLand. Due to unforeseen of another group spying, we have talked as a 
	group and made a plan that we would contribute to pay for a private repository. In addition,
	Kat and I have researched for png files that we would use to create a new page for 
	incubation.

Today I will begin to create a screen for the egg incubator. In addition, I will make an Egg
	class that extends the GraphicComponent class. Furthermore, I will create an outline of the
	methods that will need to be created in the egg. On Monday, I wish to continue working on
	making a structure of the Egg class and Incubator screen class. When I am finished working
	on it on Monday, I hope to discuss with Katya how we will each be putting our part for the 
	symposium.
