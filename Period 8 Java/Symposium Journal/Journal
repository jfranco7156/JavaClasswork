Today I will begin to research the skill I have chosen to implement into
	my program, DragonLand. Due to unforeseen of another group spying, we have talked as a 
	group and made a plan that we would contribute to pay for a private repository. In addition,
	Kat and I have researched for png files that we would use to create a new page for 
	incubation.

Today I will begin to create a screen for the egg incubator. In addition, I will make an Egg
	class that extends the GraphicComponent class. Furthermore, I will create an outline of the
	methods that will need to be created in the egg. On Monday, I wish to continue working on
	making a structure of the Egg class and Incubator screen class. When I am finished working
	on it on Monday, I hope to discuss with Katya how we will each be putting our part for the 
	symposium.

Today I will be continuing my work of programming part of the Egg class to later exchange 
	with Kat. I will also continue working on parts of the Incubator to work out some 
	logistics to encounter less problems in the future. Today, I have accomplished my goal of 
	removing the 'extends MovableComponent' on the Egg class because Tamanna had previously 
	changed MovableComponent to specifically work with her Star class. Thus, Violetta has tasked
	herself with creating a new general class to let the rest of group use MovableComponent.
	I have also programmed some methods on the IncubatorScreen.
